I want to complete this course, complete second course (React) and get a job in EPAM Systems.
I think, it is the best company in Belarus, because it's native and popular organisation. I want to develop with employees, because they have
real experience in many projects and it's will be boost for my develop.
I'am experiensed in C, C++, Python, JS, HTML, CSS and Delphy. I studi them in the Uneversity.
